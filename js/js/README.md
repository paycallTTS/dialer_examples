The following examples provides two types of syntaxes:

  1. Plain old Javascript using [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
  2. Ecmascript v6, using: [node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios), [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), [babel](https://babeljs.io/), [uuid](https://github.com/kelektiv/node-uuid).



## Plain old Javascript

The current example hold inside HTML and direct link to jQuery 1.x.

It is recommended to open the developer tools, to see what is going on. There are not outputs for the HTML part at all.
